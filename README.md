# URMICHE - URl MIgration CHEcker

When you migrate a website (for example from one technology to another) usually you change the URLs, but you don't want to lose the old URLs, so you redirect them to the new ones. But, how are you sure you did it right?

URMICHE is a simple tool that verify a list of URLs and show you the HTTP status (if they are correct or not) and all the redirections. So you can verify easily that the old URLs works fine and are redirected to the new ones.


## How to use

It is very simple, follow the next steps:

1.  Prepare a simple text file with all the URLs that you want to check, one in each line.
2.  Upload the file to URMICHE. It will tell you how many URLs it found in the file.
3.  Click the really big green button.
4.  Wait for the result.
5.  Smile  :)
